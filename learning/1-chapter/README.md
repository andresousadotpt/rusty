> Installed rustup via `sudo pacman -S rustup` then used `rustup update` and `rustup default stable`

When using `!` we know that we are using a macro. <br>
We can run `cargo run` so we can run our binary. <br>
We can run `cargo build` so we can build our binary without running it <br>
We can check if the code is compilable via `cargo check` command, thus will not generate a binary out of it. <br>
